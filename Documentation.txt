# MoveAll

MoveAll is a Python-based file management utility with a graphical user interface. It allows users to move files from a source directory (or ZIP file) to a destination directory, organizing them based on file extensions.

## Features

- Select source folder or ZIP file
- Choose destination folder
- Filter files by extension
- Move files in batches for improved performance
- Progress bar and status updates
- Cancellation and undo functionality
- Multilingual support (currently supports Portuguese)
- Logging for error tracking

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- tkinter
- psutil
- gettext (for localization)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install psutil
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the script:
   ```
   python moveall_backend.py
   ```
2. Use the GUI to:
   - Select a source folder or ZIP file
   - Choose a destination folder
   - Select file extensions to move (optional)
   - Click "Move Files" to start the process

## Main Components

- `FileManager`: The main class that handles the file operations and GUI.
- `iniciar_interface()`: Sets up the graphical user interface.
- `selecionar_pasta_origem()`: Allows user to select the source folder.
- `selecionar_zip_origem()`: Allows user to select a ZIP file as source.
- `selecionar_destino()`: Allows user to select the destination folder.
- `mover_arquivos()`: Handles the file moving process.
- `cancelar_mover_arquivos()`: Cancels the ongoing file moving operation.
- `desfazer_movimentacao()`: Undoes the file movement if cancelled.

## Performance Optimization

- Files are moved in batches to improve performance.
- Batch size is dynamically adjusted based on CPU usage and file sizes.
- Small files (< 1MB) are moved in larger batches for efficiency.

## Localization

The project supports multiple languages. Currently, it includes Portuguese translations. To add more languages:

1. Create new .po files in the `locales` directory.
2. Update the `gettext.translation()` call with the new language codes.

## Logging

Errors are logged to `moveall.log` for troubleshooting purposes.

# Libraries Used in MoveAll

1. os: For file and directory operations
2. sys: For system-specific parameters and functions
3. shutil: For high-level file operations
4. tkinter: For creating the graphical user interface
5. threading: For running file operations in a separate thread
6. logging: For error logging
7. gettext: For internationalization and localization
8. psutil: For monitoring system resources (CPU usage)
9. zipfile: For handling ZIP files
10. tempfile: For creating temporary directories

Additional tkinter modules:
- filedialog: For file and directory selection dialogs
- messagebox: For displaying message boxes
- ttk: For themed widgets (used for the progress bar)

Note: Most of these libraries are part of Python's standard library, except for psutil, which needs to be installed separately.
